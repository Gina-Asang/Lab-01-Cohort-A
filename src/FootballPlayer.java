   Lab_01_cohortA
   Objectives
• Practice basic Java syntax with variables, data types, and initialization.
• Apply type casting, increment/decrement operators, and logical operators.
• Use selection statements: if/else, nested ifs, switch, and conditional expressions.
• Understand and practice switch fall-through (running cases), both as a mistake and as a
useful grouping technique.
• Combine all concepts into a single, working player selection simulator

Final Results
At the end of the lab, you will have a Java program that:
• Accepts player details (name, age, height, weight, jersey number) from the keyboard.
• Converts height to centimeters and rounds weight.
• Categorizes the player as Rising Star, Prime Player, or Veteran.
• Identifies the player’s position based on the jersey number.
• Determines whether the jersey number is an attacker number.
• Evaluates eligibility using logical conditions.
• Decides whether the player is in the starting lineup (nested if).
• Outputs a structured “Player Report” with a final decision: Play or Rest.
• Demonstrates how a switch behaves with missing breaks (unwanted fall-through) and
how to use grouped cases correctly
